#+title: whisper-api: Asynchronous Speech-to-Text for Emacs

whisper-api is a lightweight asynchronous client for OpenAI's Whisper API.

** Installation

Make sure you have ffmpeg installed on your system. For example, on Ubuntu:

  =$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg=

Using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] and [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] (if you use them), add this to your configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package whisper-api
  :straight (:host github :repo "ileixe/whisper-api")
  :config
  (setq whisper-api-openai-token "YOUR-API-KEY") ;; or you can uses .authinfo file
  :general
  ;; Global bindings for normal, visual and insert states
  (:states '(normal visual insert)
           "C-c w" 'whisper-api-record-dwim
           "C-c c" 'whisper-api-cancel)
  ;; Bindings for the minibuffer-keymaps so that they also work inside the minibuffer.
  ;; (:keymaps '(minibuffer-local-map minibuffer-local-ns-map)
  ;;          "C-c w" 'whisper-api-record-dwim
  ;;          "C-c c" 'whisper-api-cancel)
  )
#+end_src

** Features

- Non-blocking recording and transcription.
- Graceful cancellation of recording or pending API requests.
- Supports reading the API key from the user variable or from authinfo.
- Customizable ffmpeg command (default uses PulseAudio, but can be adjusted to ALSA or other sources).

** Usage

1. Set your API key, for example in your init file:

       =(setq whisper-api-openai-token "sk-...")=

   If not set, the package will fallback on .authinfo file:

       =machine api.openai.com login apikey password YOUR_API_KEY=

2. To start recording, run:

       =M-x whisper-api-record-dwim=

   The temporary file path is displayed in the minibuffer.

3. To stop recording (which sends the audio file to the API asynchronously), run:

       =M-x whisper-api-record-dwim=   (again)

   The transcription is then inserted into your current buffer.

4. To cancel an active recording or pending API call, run:

       =M-x whisper-api-cancel=

** Customization

- *whisper-api-ffmpeg-command*

  The format string used to invoke ffmpeg. By default it is:

    =ffmpeg -y -t %d -f pulse -i default -ar 16000 %s=

  You can modify this if you use another input device; for instance, if you prefer ALSA use:

    =(setq whisper-api-ffmpeg-command "ffmpeg -y -t %d -f alsa -i default -ar 16000 %s")=

- *whisper-api-base-url*

  The base URL for the Whisper API. By default it is set to OpenAI's endpoint:

    =https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions=

  To use a local inference endpoint or alternative service, set this value accordingly. For example:

    =(setq whisper-api-base-url "http://localhost:8000/my-endpoint")=

- The package prints debug messages in the *Messages* buffer, which can help diagnose issues with the recording or API call.

Enjoy!
